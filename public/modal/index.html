        <h1 id="titlemodal">Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</h1>
        <p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Kids don't turn
            rotten just from watching TV. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until
            January 3rd.</p>
        <p>No argument here. Who are you, my warranty?! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you
            say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible
            ravages of youth. <strong> Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours.</strong>
            <em> And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks.</em> Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>

        <input type="text">

        <h2>I never loved you.</h2>
        <p>Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't
            rock. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</p>
        <ol>

            <li>For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</li>
            <li>And I'm his friend Jesus.</li>
            <li>Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Tell them I hate them.</h3>
        <p>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?
            You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough
            to feel ways about stuff!</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Oh, I think we should just stay friends.</li>
            <li>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</li>
            <li>Actually, that's still true.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? You'll have all the Slurm you can
            drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really
            have the pure strength of 'will'?</p>
        <p>Hello Morbo, how's the family? Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Well I'da done better, but it's plum
            hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. With a warning label this big, you
            know they gotta be fun!</p>
        <p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. A true inspiration for the
            children. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid
            food.</p>
        <p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Michelle, I don't
            regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. I am the man
            with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</p>
        <p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. What are you hacking off?
            Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one
            hooker.</p>
        <p>Why did you bring us here? And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. In your time,
            yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom
            I killed for their stemcells.</p>
        <p>Really?! Noooooo! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? I videotape every customer that comes in
            here, so that I may blackmail them later. Pansy. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</p>
        <p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Spare me your space age technobabble,
            Attila the Hun! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Oh, all right,
            I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>
        <p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Why not indeed! Morbo can't
            understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a
            hat.</p>
        <p>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I'm a thing. Enough about your promiscuous
            mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Anyone who laughs is a
            communist!</p>
        <p>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually
            wriggling through them. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the
            bumper cars.</p>
